# What Cheer Netop

> In a canoe with several others, Roger scouted the area across the Seekonk River. They spotted a group of Narragansett on a large rock, known afterwards as Slate Rock, along the western shore of the Seekonk River. As they approached the Narragansett greeted them by calling out: “What Cheer Netop!” This greeting is a combination of English and Narragansett languages. ‘What cheer’ was an informal common English greeting of the day, short for ‘what cheery news do you bring’ and today’s equivalent of “what’s up?’’ “Netop” is the Narragansett word for friend.

What Cheer is an MIT licensed implementation of [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse)/[ActivityPub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub)
in [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) and [Lift](https://liftweb.net) by
[David Pollak](https://macaw.social/@dpp).

The implementation is based on [ActivityPub-Express](https://github.com/immers-space/activitypub-express) which is also MIT licensed.


## Why?

A JVM-based ActivityPub server has performance and deployment advantages.

Scala and Lift are well known to David Pollak

An MIT licensed ActivityPub server has value in terms of commercial extensions
that most of the AGPL implementations don't lend themselves to.
